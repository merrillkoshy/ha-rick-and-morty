This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and authored by Merrill Koshy Thomas.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Why NextJS?

For me, NextJS has been the perfectly documented, thoroughly thought of library built on React and Nodejs. It does a lot of development optimizations on its own and facilitates, or rather makes the developer adhere to it. For a fullstack app, this is definitely your go-to and I have been using this for the past 3 years.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
